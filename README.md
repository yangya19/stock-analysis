# stock-analysis

##1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis

Make a report on entire stock markets in year 2017 and 2018, with numbers for total daily volume, return rate for all tickers in the stock market, in an efficient VBA script. 

##2. Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

The stock market performs better in 2017 than 2018. The average return rate for entire stockmarket in 2017 is 67.3%, which is significatnly higher than stock market performance in 2018, with average return rate -8.5%. 

Running time on my laptop with original script is around 0.43 seconds, and refactored code is 0.08 seconds. That is about 4.3 times faster.

##3. Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
    ######1) What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

    The advantages for refactoring codes include: it simplified support and code updates since code is much cleaner; it saved time and money in the future, because it reduces the likelihood of errors in the future. It also reduces complexity for easier understanding, and makes the script easier to maintain. 

    ######2) How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

    The run time for the refactoring code is significantly reduced. The refactoring code also provides convience for future modifications. 
    The cons is refactoring code is more time consuming than original script.
