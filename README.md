Running time on my laptop with original script is around 0.43 seconds, and refactored code is 0.08 seconds. That is about 4.3 times faster.

It also reduces complexity for easier understanding, and makes the script easier to maintain. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

    The run time for the refactoring code is significantly reduced. The refactoring code also provides convience for future modifications.
